# Diabetes Prediction using Decision Tree Regressor

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting diabetes using the Decision Tree Regressor from the `sklearn` library. The dataset used for this analysis is the Diabetes dataset, which is included in the `datasets` module of `sklearn`. The model's hyperparameters are optimized using Grid Search CV to achieve better accuracy. Finally, the decision tree is visualized using the `tree` module in `sklearn`.

## Features

- **Dataset**: Diabetes dataset from `sklearn.datasets`.
- **Model**: Decision Tree Regressor.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid Search CV for optimal parameters.
- **Visualization**: Visualization of the decision tree.
